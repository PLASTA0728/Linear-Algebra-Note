# Linear-Algebra-Note
This is my linear algebra note of RiceX class.
You can simply latex the files in the current directory if you like. I will also put my whole note on the website after finishing it.
If you want to contact me, my email address is 17757285025@163.com 

The template of the note is https://github.com/dev-aditya/LaTeX-template. The note is still updating. All of the LaTeX codes except my notes can be found on it.
